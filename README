Here's an example, using the following folders:

	Some Album [Disc 1]/
		01 Song A.mp3
		02 Song B.mp3
		…

	Some Album [Disc 2]/
		01 Song P.mp3
		02 Song Q.mp3
		…

This command

	album-unify 'Some Album [Disc 1]' 'Some Album [Disc 2]'

will create this folder and delete the other two:

	Some Album/
		1-01 Song A.mp3
		1-02 Song B.mp3
		…
		2-01 Song P.mp3
		2-02 Song Q.mp3
		…
